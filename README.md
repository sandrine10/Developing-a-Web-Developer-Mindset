# Developing-a-Web-Developer-Mindset
1. Write a letter to your future self using what you’ve learned. How will you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you tackle challenges? How will what you’ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?
2. Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals. Is there a dream job you’re working toward? Is there a project idea you’ve been aching to start working on?


# **Letter to Self**


To my future self,

How are you doing? Are you still acquiring new skills of Development? I 
hope you are. Because we all know that learning new skills is often 
intimidating. When you are learning something new, there are enormous gaps 
in your understanding of the topic. You are very aware of what you don't 
know, and you don't know where to begin. That ambiguity generates fear and 
uncertainty, both of which make the ancient survival-oriented parts of your 
brain freak out. What's the easiest way to stop feeling afraid? Give up. 
But please, Sandrine, don't you dare give up, keep pushing through and 
eventually you will master the art of coding :-), well, maybe not mastering 
it but you know what I mean.

Do you still let the frustration take the best out of you? If so, just 
remember that learning new skills is usually frustrating. Indecision, 
intimidation, tension and frustration are universal barriers to skill 
acquisition, so don't let those factors stop you reaching your goals. 

But when you do get at the point of frustration, just remember "Growth 
mindset" from Joyce Akiko's "How To Navigate The Up And Downs Of Learning 
To Code". So you should:

- Take a break, yeah, you do need a break because at this point, nothing 
good will come out of the frustration.

- Go walk Dolce, you know, that's what he lives for... not only walking 
will clear your mind but also your furry little mutt will be happier. So it's a 
win-win situation for both of you.

- Listen to music that penetrate your soul, oh yeah, listen to Pang 
(Touch). Side note, I just put it on. Don't you worry I am still able to 
concentrate when I listen to music that penetrate my soul.

- Or go do some DYI projects, you know that's what you love to do.

After taking a break and maybe doing one or two of those things, you will be able to see the problem 
with fresh eyes and that might do the trick.

And once you are back, here are some helpful suggestions:

1. Draw pictures and diagrams. It'll give you another perspective on the 
problem, and force you to think through the logic of what you are trying to 
do. Get the problem out of your head.

2. Google and Stack Overflow- paste your errors into Google- the answer may 
pop right up, or at least give you some ideas on how to proceed.

3. Reach out for help. Ask developers at work for help, use forums in the 
course, try Slack too.

4. Keep going! Try to make a little progress each day.

Keep shining, keep grinding, keep learning and keep improving. My dear 
Sandrine, I am going to leave you with these words:

*"Behind every success is effort... behind every effort is passion... 
behind every passion is someone with the courage to try." Unknown.* 

*Tension is who you think you should be.  Relaxation is who you are.* 
~Chinese Proverb*

Best,

Your younger self, (Sandrine).

# **My Goals**

## **Personal Goal:**

One of my personal goal is to allow myself to be whoever I am, allowing 
myself to relinquish my plans for who I should become, allowing myself to 
simply show up, and for that to be enough, more than enough. And be a 
better person than yesterday.

## **Career Goal:**

As I am learning computer programming, I can see myself in the future as an 
accomplished software developer who will never stop learning new skills of 
programming. But also, I want to be a screenwriter, why not? I can do both, 
I have few talents.

## **Project Goal:**

I have few projects on my mind that I'd love to do.
